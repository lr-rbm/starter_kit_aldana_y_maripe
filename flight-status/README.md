# Flight Status

A heads-up display for Meta Display glasses that surfaces the four things you actually need at the airport — **terminal, gate, boarding time, carousel** — plus your seat. Pick a flight without typing a single character, and keep the information glanceable while you walk.

## What it does

- **Type-free flight lookup.** Pick airline from a carousel of 15 carriers (AA, UA, DL, B6, …), set a 4-digit flight number with a wheel picker, pick today or tomorrow — all with ◀ ▶ ▲ ▼ and Enter.
- **Persistent status display.** Three swipeable views — **MAIN** (TERMINAL · GATE · BOARD with gate + boarding time emphasized in amber), **SEAT** (big cyan seat code with class + window/aisle role), and **CAROUSEL** (big amber baggage-claim number). Status badge (ON TIME / DELAYED / BOARDING) and DEP/ARR times stay anchored at top and bottom.
- **Compact mode.** Swipe up to collapse into a single pinned strip at the top of the lens — same three sub-views, all the same height so the strip doesn't jump when you cycle. Swipe down to expand again.
- **Last-flight memory.** The home screen remembers the most recent flight you checked; press ▲ + Enter to re-open it instantly with no wizard.

All mock data is deterministic — the same airline + flight + date hash always renders the same terminal / gate / board / carousel / seat / status, so the demo behaves predictably.

> ℹ️ For a production build, the [aviationstack API](https://aviationstack.com/) can be plugged in to swap the deterministic mock for real-time data — it covers airline / flight / terminal / gate / scheduled + estimated times. It was left out of this demo to keep it self-contained and to avoid the API-key dependency.

## Running locally

The app is a single static HTML/CSS/JS bundle — no build step.

```bash
npx serve -l 4214 flight-status
# then open http://localhost:4214
```

For development inside the meta-display-glasses-webapps workspace it's also wired into `.claude/launch.json` as the `flight-status` preview target on port **4214**.

### Regenerating screenshots

> 🛠️ **Developer tooling only.** The app itself has zero Chrome dependency — it's vanilla HTML/CSS/JS that runs in the Ray-Ban Meta Display's built-in browser. The block below is just the local recipe used on a Mac to refresh the PNGs in `screenshots/`.

The screenshots above are produced from headless Chrome against the `?state=…` URL parameter the app reads on load:

```bash
npx serve -l 4314 flight-status &
CHROME="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
for STATE in home-find home-last airline number date \
             status-main status-seat status-carousel \
             compact-main compact-seat compact-carousel; do
  "$CHROME" --headless --disable-gpu --hide-scrollbars \
    --window-size=600,600 --virtual-time-budget=3000 \
    --screenshot="flight-status/screenshots/$STATE.png" \
    "http://localhost:4314/?state=$STATE"
done
```
