# Pinout HUD

A heads-up display for Meta Display glasses that keeps the four things you need while soldering an ESP32 in your right peripheral vision — **pin number, label, wire colour, and a glanceable schematic**. Drive every screen with directional swipes plus a tap; never put the iron down to check a datasheet.

## What it does

- **Four ESP32 templates built in.** WROOM-32, CAM, ESP8266 NodeMCU, and S3-Mini ship with sensible default wire colours (GND→black, 3V3→red, GPIO→blue, TX→green, RX→yellow, SPI→purple / white). Pick a board, optionally cycle any pin's colour, finalize.
- **Custom-board flow without typing.** A 5 × 9 spatial grid of the most common pin labels (power · control · I²C · SPI · GPIO0–39 · analog / digital). Swipe to land on any label in ≤4 moves, tap to confirm. The wire-colour step is a separate screen with the conventional colour pre-focused, so the typical pin commits in two taps.
- **Active reference HUD.** Right-aligned vertical pin list, each row with a glowing wire stub + terminal end-cap so the colours read as schematic chrome, not screen junk.
- **Focus Mode.** Right-swipe from the reference list to zoom the selected pin huge in the centre-right while the rest dims to 18 % — so when your hands are busy you can't solder the wrong pad.
- **Subtle PCB-trace flourishes.** A background `<canvas>` paints five thin polylines along the left gutter + corners, with a slow accent "current" pulse sliding each trace on its own loop. Pure decoration; never overlaps active content.
- **Right-weighted lens layout.** `--pad-l: 160px` parks every screen against the right side of the 600 × 600 lens so the user sees content where their projected display actually is.

## Running locally

The app is a single static HTML/CSS/JS bundle — no build step.

```bash
npx serve -l 4208 pinout-hud
# then open http://localhost:4208
```

For development inside the `meta-display-glasses-webapps` workspace it's also wired into `.claude/launch.json` as the `pinout-hud` preview target on port **4208**.

### Regenerating screenshots

> 🛠️ **Developer tooling only.** The app itself has zero Chrome dependency — it's vanilla HTML/CSS/JS that runs in the Ray-Ban Meta Display's built-in browser. The block below is just the local recipe used on a Mac to refresh the PNGs in `screenshots/`.

The screenshots above are produced from headless Chrome against the `?state=…` URL parameter the app reads on load:

```bash
npx serve -l 4308 pinout-hud &
CHROME="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
for STATE in home walkthrough esp32-list esp32-color-assign \
             esp32-reference focus-mode custom-count \
             custom-label-1 custom-color-1 custom-label-2 \
             custom-color-2 custom-reference; do
  "$CHROME" --headless --disable-gpu --hide-scrollbars \
    --window-size=600,600 --virtual-time-budget=3000 \
    --screenshot="pinout-hud/screenshots/$STATE.png" \
    "http://localhost:4308/?state=$STATE"
done
```
